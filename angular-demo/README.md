This demo uses the default `IdbContext`. Especially note 
[data-store.service.ts](https://github.com/normalized-db/examples/blob/master/angular-demo/src/app/core/service/data-store.service.ts) 
in `app/core/service` (used as interface between the app and the normalized-db-libraries) 
and [schema.ts](https://github.com/normalized-db/examples/blob/master/angular-demo/src/assets/data/schema.ts)
in `app/assets/data` (describing the data-model used for normalization).

For instructions on how to run the app after installing the dependencies (`npm install`), please refer to the [Angular-CLI docs](https://cli.angular.io/).
